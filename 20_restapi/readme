DISCO:
-Using an API key to access an image from NASA using a browser returns a JSON file
-We can read the JSON file using urlopen from urllib.request
-JSON is stored as a dictionary using json.loads

QCC:
-Having to use urllib.request seems a bit bloated, can we access the contents of a JSON file stored on another server without it?
-What's the difference between using a JSON file and using a dictionary or CSV?
